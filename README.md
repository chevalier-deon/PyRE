PyRE is a modular, open source library for epidemiologic calculations in Python and R*. The Python version's only dependency is Pandas, and the R version will hopefully be dependency-free.

Modules in the Python version can be imported separately (i.e., `from pyre import causality as cslt`).

(*R support not yet added)
